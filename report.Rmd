## Introduction
This report addresses the following question: 
Do businesses (in the same or in different geographic locations / with same or different categories) share review patterns (stars, number of reviews, number of tips) over time? I want to find out if and how well it is possible to predict ratings for a business based on existing yelp reviews from other businesses.
