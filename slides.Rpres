<<<<<<< HEAD
Do businesses (in the same or in different geographic locations / with same or different categories) share review patterns (stars, number of reviews, number of tips) over time? I want to find out if and how well it is possible to predict ratings for a business based on existing yelp reviews from other businesses.

* Coursera Data Science Capstone Project
    - using data from the *Yelp Dataset Challenge*
* Primary Question:   
    *Do seasonal review patterns exists in the Yelp Dataset?*

Methods
========================================================

Some Yelp categories show patterns in average quarterly ratings.  

```{r init,fig.width=10, fig.height=4, dpi=300, out.width="1200px", out.height="350px", cache = TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(zoo)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(gridExtra)

load("~/Documents/coursera/dataScience/Capstone/DataScience_Capstone/season_small.RData")
p1 <- ggplot(data=agg_categories, aes(x=quarter, y=rating, group=category, color=category)) + 
        geom_line() + geom_point() + xlab("Year / Quarter") + ylab("average rating") + 
        labs(title="Average Ratings per Quarter") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
        theme(legend.position="bottom")
p2 <- ggplot(data=agg_sport, aes(x=quarter, y=rating, group=1)) + 
        geom_line() + geom_point() + xlab("Year / Quarter") + ylab("average rating") + 
        labs(title="Sport Ratings per Quarter") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

A T-Test shall answer the question if those patterns for Yelp sports categories have a significant relation to the time of the year (season).

Results
========================================================

**Null Hypothesis $H_0$**:  
The season (time of the year) has no effect on sports activity ratings.  

**T-Test Result**:
```{r ttest, cache = TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
t <- t.test(agg_sport$rating, agg_restaurant$rating, 
            paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE)
result <- data.frame("p-value" = t$p.value, 
                     "CI.low" = t$conf[1], "CI.high" = t$conf[2])
kable(result, format = 'html')
```

**Interpretation**:  
the confidence interval does not contain 0 and the p-value is less than 5% so $H_0$ can be rejected


Discussion
========================================================

**Answer to the primary question:**  
The season has an effect on sports activity ratings. 

**Interpretation:**  
Ratings are higher at the begin of the year (maybe this is releated to New Year's resolutions  / positive spirit on starting a new activity)


**Assumptions for T-Test:**  

* experiment was done with a random assignment of participants
* the sample ratings are representative for the overall population
